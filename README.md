# 👋 Hi, I'm Kush Gulati  

🎯 **Bioinformatics Researcher | Computational Biologist | Data Scientist**  

### 🧬 About Me  
I’m passionate about exploring biological systems through computation — combining genomics, spatial transcriptomics, and data-driven approaches to understand gene regulation, cellular diversity, and cancer biology.

My experience spans:  
- **Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics**  
- **Gene expression regulation** (skin ageing, alternative splicing, mutually exclusive exons)  
- **Protein structure prediction and bioinformatics algorithms**  
- **Statistical and machine learning analysis**
